# Notes
All language objects must have the same properties.
Values can only be of string or string array type

# False info 

I'm human too, so I probably will make some errors on the info for these languages. Feel free to submit an issue highlighting the mistake and I'll be happy to fix it! 

# Updating language fields

See any fields with "Not updated" on them? Please fill in with correct info and submit a PR. 

# Adding fields

Copy paste the current `data.json` text into `data_copy.json`

Run the `add_field.py` file and follow the steps to add a field for all current languages

```python
python3 add_field.py
```

Then update the value of the field for the respective language.
